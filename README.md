# Food Nutrition Projects

This repository contains four major projects related to food nutrition analysis and prediction. Each project focuses on different aspects of analyzing and utilizing nutrient data to support various dietary needs and decision-making processes.

## 1. Food Nutrient Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis

### Description
This project involved performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the FoodData Central Dataset obtained from Kaggle. The goal was to synthesize nutrient content to support customer's dietary needs by identifying key insights through regression, correlation analysis, and other statistical techniques.

### Tools and Skills
- Python for data cleaning and statistical analysis
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for code execution and documentation

## 2. Nutrient Classification based on Food Category with Deep Learning (MLP)

### Description
In this project, a deep learning model was developed to classify nutrients based on food categories. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network architecture was employed to categorize nutrients effectively. The model aimed to provide accurate classification results to assist in dietary planning and analysis.

### Tools and Skills
- Python for data preprocessing and model development
- TensorFlow, Keras for deep learning implementation
- Scikit-learn for model evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and documentation

## 3. Calories Prediction by Nutrients with Machine Learning Models

### Description
This project focused on predicting calorie content based on nutrient information using various machine learning models. The goal was to develop accurate prediction models to estimate calorie values from nutrient data. Different machine learning algorithms were employed and compared to determine the best-performing model.

### Tools and Skills
- Python for data preprocessing and model training
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms implementation
- Feature engineering techniques for data transformation
- Jupyter Notebook for model development and evaluation

## 4. Food Nutrients Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

### Description
This project involved creating an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze food nutrient data. The dashboard provided comprehensive insights into nutrient composition across different food categories. Users could explore and understand the nutrient content of various foods efficiently through interactive visualizations.

### Tools and Skills
- Power BI for dashboard creation and visualization
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Data modeling and visualization best practices
- Communication skills for presenting insights effectively
